It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":246079,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Unified logger"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6979,"reviewCount":3733,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1569159327000},{"id":"https-everywhere@eff.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"HTTPS Everywhere","version":"2019.6.27","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3060290/https_everywhere-2019.6.27-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","supportURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","description":"Encrypt the web!

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":3797,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":473,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":453,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","thumbnailWidth":538,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","thumbnailWidth":423,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","thumbnailWidth":380,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5849,"reviewCount":224,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1568299494000},{"id":"{4a313247-8330-4a81-948e-b79936516f78}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/93/93451-32.png?modified=1561662856","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/93/93451-64.png?modified=1561662856","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/93/93451-128.png?modified=1561662856"},"name":"Image Search Options","version":"3.0.12","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3059971/image_search_options-3.0.12-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"http://saucenao.com/","supportURL":null,"description":"Image Search Options provides a set of highly customizable reverse image search context menu options.","fullDescription":"This Firefox Extension adds a set of customizable context menu options to the right click menu of images.
